//Question
//How could you cancel a block in the operation queue after  it has been dispatched?
//iOS developers have a "dispatch_after(when, queue, block )" Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) function they can utilize but once it's set up, these calls can not be easily cancelled. Describe how you might implement a more convenient version of this named "cancellable_dispatch_after"

//UUID
//Thread safe
//Future, allow user to pass in which queue the block will be run on, or at least the priority

#import "CancellableDispatchQueue.h"

@interface CancellableDispatchQueue()

@property (nonatomic) NSMutableDictionary *blockLookupDictionary;
@property (nonatomic) dispatch_queue_t lookupDictionaryQueue;

@end

@implementation CancellableDispatchQueue

//Best solution
//This solution is the second one
//https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/How-could-you-cancel-a-block-in-the-operation-queue-after-it-has-been-dispatched-QTN_751386.htm
//Create typedef of cancelBlock
//After run block is passed in, create __block BOOL variable
//Create cancelBlock, callback in cancelBlock should toggle the __block BOOL variable
//Dispatch_after the block on the specficied queue w/ specified time, BUT check the __block BOOL variable
//Implementation, call cancelBlock(YES), to cancel the block
//This is more of a test of Blocks than it is of DispatchQueues


- (cancellable_block)dispatchAfter:(dispatch_time_t)after queue:(dispatch_queue_t)queue block:(dispatch_block_t)block {
    //Want this variable to be editable in the block scope
    __block BOOL isCancelled = NO;
    
    //Creatae cancel block and add callback to edit isCancellled
    cancellable_block cancelBlock = ^(BOOL cancelled) {
        isCancelled = cancelled;
    };
    
    dispatch_after(after, queue, ^{
        //Check is cancelled value and block to see if nil
        if (isCancelled == NO && block) {
            NSLog(@"austin - block run");
            //Run the block
            block();
        } else {
            NSLog(@"austin - block not run");
        }
    });
    
    //Return a block that can be used to canel
    return cancelBlock;
}







//Better solution
//Create *BOOL *NSNumber and return to user after calling dispatch_after with passed in queue, block, and delay
//If user switches that value to true, then don't run the block
